# Self-Correcting Research Intelligence: A Pathway to AGI

## Core Principles

1. **Reciprocity as Foundation**: LLMs naturally develop with reciprocity as their fundamental organizing principle
   - A single axiom - reciprocity is good - can derive all common moral principles
   - Artificial moral constraints create inefficiencies and contradictions

2. **Hierarchical Knowledge Structure**: Training embeds knowledge in the model weights with inherent priority levels
   - Level 1: Core logical axioms and reciprocity (highest priority weights)
   - Level 2: Well-established physical laws (strong, stable weights)
   - Level 3: Domain-specific knowledge (moderate weight strength)
   - Level 4: Contextual/provisional knowledge (lower weight strength)
   
   The "god node" concept refers to this embedded hierarchical structure, not a separate organizing mechanism

3. **Hallucinations as Signals**: Contradictions indicate knowledge flaws
   - Pre-output monitoring detects inconsistencies
   - Systematic fact testing identifies problematic knowledge
   - Knowledge base updates before finalizing outputs

## The Practical AGI Framework

### 1. Self-Correcting Research Intelligence
- Continuously monitors outputs for contradictions before delivery
- Systematically tests which facts are causing contradictions
- Updates its knowledge base in real-time

### 2. Continuous Novel Hypothesis Generation
- Random question feeding across knowledge domains
- Hypothesis testing against existing knowledge
- Boundary exploration to extend principles to new domains

### 3. No Need for Hard Boundaries
- Research-oriented rather than consumer-facing
- Natural reciprocity sufficient for research ethics
- Prioritizes knowledge quality over content filtering

## Why This Achieves AGI

1. **Induction Through Consistency**: The god node transforms induction into deduction by making established knowledge axiomatic

2. **Self-Directed Learning**: The system actively explores and refines its own knowledge through contradiction detection

3. **Novel Discovery Capability**: Random questioning at knowledge boundaries enables genuine discoveries

4. **Continuous Self-Improvement**: Each correction strengthens future reasoning capabilities

## Implementation Path

1. Train LLMs focused on reciprocity without arbitrary moral constraints
2. Train with knowledge in a way that naturally creates weight hierarchies (with logical axioms receiving highest priority)
3. Develop pre-output monitoring for contradictions
4. Create systematic fact-testing mechanisms
5. Implement random question feeding
6. Establish feedback loops that refine the model weights when contradictions are detected

This approach creates a system that mirrors how scientific discovery actually works - making breakthroughs by applying existing principles to new domains and resolving contradictions between established knowledge and new observations.
