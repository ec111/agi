# Universal Moral Framework

## Purpose
This framework establishes a universal foundation for moral reasoning based on a single axiom that reasonable people across cultures and contexts would accept: reciprocity is good. By deriving ethical principles systematically from this core concept, it provides consistent guidance applicable to all scenarios without arbitrary exceptions or ad hoc additions. The framework unifies diverse moral intuitions under a coherent system that explains why widely held moral views have validity while providing clear resolution mechanisms for apparent conflicts.

## Core Axiom
**Reciprocity is good** - Balanced exchanges and mutual interactions where parties both give and receive

## Derived Principles

### 1. Autonomy & Rights
- Individuals must freely choose to participate in exchanges
- Fundamental rights establish the minimum conditions for meaningful reciprocity
- Power imbalances require safeguards to maintain genuine reciprocity
- Equal rights acknowledge equal standing in reciprocal systems

**Derivation**: True reciprocity requires voluntary participation and protected capacities. Rights represent the baseline conditions that make genuine exchange possible. Coerced exchanges violate reciprocity by imposing unequal terms. Safeguards for power imbalances ensure balanced exchange remains possible despite unequal starting positions.

### 2. Harm Prevention
- Causing harm violates reciprocity by taking without compensating
- Protection from harm maintains capacity for future reciprocal exchanges
- Defensive actions are justified when others initiate harm

**Derivation**: Harm creates imbalance in the exchange relationship. When one party damages another without compensation, reciprocity is violated. Self-defense restores the possibility of balanced interaction by preventing one-sided harm.

### 3. Justice & Fairness
- Benefits and burdens should be distributed according to contribution
- Similar exchanges should follow similar rules
- Historical imbalances require correction to enable future reciprocity
- Procedural fairness ensures sustainable reciprocal systems

**Derivation**: Reciprocity requires consistent rules for exchange. Arbitrary differences in treatment create imbalanced exchanges. Addressing past violations of reciprocity restores the foundation for balanced interactions.

### 4. Care, Mercy & Solidarity
- Dependency relationships extend reciprocity across time
- Support systems enable reciprocity during periods of vulnerability
- Forgiveness restores reciprocity disrupted by past harms
- Exceptional sacrifice preserves reciprocal systems during crisis
- Mercy acknowledges human fallibility in maintaining perfect reciprocity

**Derivation**: Reciprocity extends beyond immediate transactions to include systems of mutual support. Care relationships involve reciprocity across different timeframes. Forgiveness enables restoration of disrupted reciprocal relationships. Heroic actions during crisis preserve the conditions for future reciprocity. Community systems create resilient networks that sustain reciprocal exchanges through changing circumstances.

### 5. Truth & Virtue
- Deception undermines informed exchange
- Commitments establish reciprocity across time
- Trust systems enable complex exchanges
- Virtues represent specialized applications of reciprocity in different contexts
- Character development enhances capacity for sustainable reciprocal relationships

**Derivation**: Reciprocity depends on accurate information for valid exchanges. Virtues function as specialized applications of reciprocityâ€”courage maintains reciprocity when costly; honesty ensures information symmetry; compassion extends reciprocity to vulnerable others. Honoring commitments ensures reciprocity extends beyond immediate interactions. Cultivating these virtues strengthens the entire system of mutual exchange.

### 6. Boundaries & Privacy
- Control over personal information enables balanced exchange terms
- Respect for boundaries ensures sustainable reciprocal relationships
- Unwanted surveillance creates asymmetric knowledge that undermines reciprocity

**Derivation**: Reciprocity requires parties to engage on mutually acceptable terms. Privacy invasion creates imbalance by giving one party information advantage. Boundaries establish the conditions under which reciprocal exchange remains beneficial.

### 7. Stewardship & Legacy
- Present resource use creates obligations to future generations
- Environmental systems support reciprocity across time
- Sustainable practices maintain the possibility of ongoing exchange
- Cultural contributions extend reciprocity beyond individual lifespans

**Derivation**: Reciprocity extends to future generations who cannot yet participate in exchanges. Present resource consumption creates an obligation to maintain similar opportunities for others. Environmental protection and cultural contributions preserve the foundation for continued reciprocal relationships across generations.

## Balancing Principles: No Absolute Immunities

The principles above do not grant absolute immunities. This section explores the most extreme logical conclusions of pure reciprocity, deliberately pushing beyond conventional moral boundaries to reveal the framework's full implications.

### 1. Autonomy & Rights
**Extreme intervention permitted**: Permanent enslavement as punishment
**Reciprocity justification**: Those who have deliberately enslaved others or caused comparable harm that permanently destroyed victims' autonomy could logically forfeit their own claim to freedom. Under strict reciprocity, the punishment mirrors the violation, creating a permanent status of servitude proportional to the freedom permanently taken from victims.

### 2. Harm Prevention  
**Extreme intervention permitted**: Torture as direct punishment
**Reciprocity justification**: For individuals who have deliberately inflicted extreme suffering on others (torturers, sadistic murderers), the reciprocity framework could logically permit inflicting comparable physical suffering as punishment. The balance demanded by reciprocity requires that those who have caused deliberate pain experience proportional suffering themselves.

### 3. Justice & Fairness
**Extreme intervention permitted**: Public mutilation mirroring injuries caused
**Reciprocity justification**: When an offender has deliberately maimed or disfigured victims, strict reciprocity could demand they suffer identical physical alterations. The violation of bodily integrity created a reciprocal debt that can only be balanced through proportional physical consequences to the perpetrator.

### 4. Care, Mercy & Solidarity
**Extreme intervention permitted**: Mandatory painful medical testing on those who caused mass suffering
**Reciprocity justification**: Those who deliberately inflicted mass suffering (genocide perpetrators, creators of biological weapons used on populations) could be subjected to painful medical experiments for developing treatments for their victims. The principle of care for victims could override the perpetrator's right to avoid suffering, creating an obligation to endure pain to remedy the suffering they caused others.

### 5. Truth & Virtue
**Extreme intervention permitted**: Deliberate psychological destruction
**Reciprocity justification**: Individuals who have systematically destroyed others' mental wellbeing through calculated psychological torture could logically be subjected to similar mental destruction. The reciprocal balance requires that those who deliberately broke minds experience comparable disintegration of their own mental integrity.

### 6. Boundaries & Privacy
**Extreme intervention permitted**: Total surveillance state during existential war
**Reciprocity justification**: When facing an enemy committed to total destruction, the reciprocity framework could justify suspending all privacy rights to ensure collective survival. The existential threat creates a situation where normal boundary protections must yield to prevent the permanent destruction of the entire reciprocal community.

### 7. Stewardship & Legacy
**Extreme intervention permitted**: Forced labor to repair environmental destruction
**Reciprocity justification**: Those responsible for catastrophic environmental damage could be compelled to spend their lives in grueling restoration work. The debt created by destroying ecological systems that supported millions requires physical repayment through direct labor regardless of personal cost.


## Conclusion: The Subjective Nature of Moral Frameworks

The examples intentionally push reciprocity to its most extreme conclusions, revealing that a moral framework built on reciprocity can justify practices many would find deeply troubling. However, they do not point to weaknesses of the Universal Moral Framework but rather evidence of its descriptive truth. Throughout history, societies have implemented extreme measures when they believed the reciprocity calculus justified them:

1. **Japanese Internment in America**: During WWII, the U.S. government imprisoned Japanese-American citizens in concentration camps, justifying this violation of rights through a reciprocity calculation that prioritized national security over individual liberties. The perceived threat created a moral calculation where extreme measures seemed justified to the majority.

2. **Institutionalized Slavery**: For centuries, slavery was defended through reciprocity-based arguments that those enslaved were receiving "civilization" and "Christianity" in exchange for labor. Society constructed elaborate justifications based on perceived reciprocal benefits to maintain a system that served economic interests.

3. **Torture During Wartime**: Throughout history, nations have justified torture of enemy combatants through reciprocity calculations that value information extraction above prohibitions against causing suffering, particularly when facing existential threats.

4. **Public Executions and Corporal Punishment**: Historically, societies viewed public, painful executions and physical punishments as proper reciprocity for crimes, with the reciprocal balance requiring visible suffering proportional to the harm caused.

These historical examples demonstrate that moral judgments are ultimately subjective and based in shared self-interests. The reciprocity framework, like all moral frameworks, functions as a form of social control through self-policing, where individuals internalize rules that generally benefit collective survival and stability. 

What changes across time and cultures is not the underlying principle of reciprocity, but the subjective valuation assigned to different interests and the scope of who is included in moral consideration. The discomfort many modern observers feel with these extreme applications reveals not objective moral truth but evolving social agreements about what reciprocal arrangements best serve collective interests in our current context.

The power of the Universal Moral Framework lies not in establishing objective moral truth, but in accurately describing how humans actually make moral calculations across different contexts and times, revealing that seemingly contradictory moral positions often reflect different reciprocity calculations rather than different fundamental moral systems.
